## 🧠 Central Theme: High blood omega-3 levels are associated with reduced risk of early-onset dementia.

### 1. 🔍 Context & Background
- **Early-Onset Dementia (EOD)**
    - Diagnosis before age 65
    - High socio-economic burden
    - Less studied than Late-Onset Dementia (LOD)
    - Diet as a modifiable risk factor is under-explored
- **Omega-3 Fatty Acids**
    - Known benefits for LOD prevention (mostly studied in >65y)
    - Objective measure: Blood levels reflect dietary intake

### 2. 🧪 Methodology
- **Data Source:** UK Biobank cohort
- **Participants:**
    - 217,122 individuals
    - Age: 40-64 years
    - Baseline: Free of dementia
- **Exposure Assessment:**
    - Total Omega-3
    - DHA (Docosahexaenoic acid)
    - Non-DHA Omega-3
    - Modeled as quintiles (Q1-Q5) and continuous variables
- **Adjustments:**
    - Sex, Age
    - APOE-ε4 allele load
    - Lifestyle factors

### 3. 📊 Key Findings
- **Follow-up:** Mean 8.3 years (325 incident EOD cases)
- **Total Omega-3:**
    - Significant inverse association
    - **Q4 vs Q1:** HR 0.62 (95% CI: 0.43-0.89)
    - **Q5 vs Q1:** HR 0.60 (95% CI: 0.42-0.86)
    - Continuous linear relationship: Higher levels = Lower risk
- **Specific Components:**
    - **Non-DHA Omega-3:** Significant protection in Q3, Q4, Q5 (vs Q1)
    - **DHA:** Inverse trend observed
- **Interaction:**
    - No significant interaction with APOE-ε4 status (benefits observed regardless of genetic risk)

### 4. ✅ Conclusion & Implications
- **Expansion of Evidence:** Omega-3 benefits extend to EOD, not just LOD.
- **Timing Matters:** Increased intake earlier in life (mid-life) may slow EOD development.
- **Future Directions:** Need validation in diverse populations.
